# Kickstarter-Analysis

## Overview of Project

Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends and obtain understanding of how various factors impact campaign outcomes. The findings are presented with tables, charts, and line graphs to help Louise get an instant access to essential information. The charts and graphs will help Louise determine a trend within the dataset and show findings in a more user-friendly method. 

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to provide Louise visual feedback in establishing a timeline, goal, and location for her Kickstarter campaign to be successful. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The line graph below will help Louise with several important points during her campaign. 

It can be noted from the chart that the launch date is important.
-	The month of May and June are peak months and the best for launching
-	The month of December is the worst for launching.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The line graph below is helpful in determining how high or low goals can impact the outcomes of a campaign and its success rate. 

-	Louise should work on producing her musicals for less because the pledged amount is much lower than successful pledge which indicates percentage failed or unsuccessful for the price being too high.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The challenge with large set of data is that it can evolve over time and not hold true to the analysis made presently. So, all the analysis done may or may not be impactful for future campaigns. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The month of May and June are peak months and the best for launching.
The month of December is the worst for launching. 


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Louise should work on producing her musicals for less because the pledged amount is much lower than successful pledge which indicates percentage failed or unsuccessful for the price being too high. In addition, it would also be helpful if we had more information on measuring the success rate. If a campaign reached its goal, what factors would determine its success in the future? 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

In order to provide Louise with a better analysis, it would be helpful to know how long she plans to run her campaign. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
If we analyzed the data by location, we can see which locations have better success than others.
